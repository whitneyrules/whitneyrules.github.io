# Coffee Hall is a place for the coffee community.

It’s a place for coffee shops, roasters and industry people to showcase their brand experience for 1-3 days. Different shops, roasters, coffee manufacturers will rotate thru and serve coffee at an elevated/new concept experience that’s a departure from the traditional cafe. Shops will have the opportunity to present coffee with any process and format including but not limited to workshops, training, coffee tastings or just a simple espresso bar. The goal is to explore a coffee dialogue thru the diverse network of coffee shops and coffee professionals.

> “I’d like to be a part of something with a bit of soul. I really want to know about the people I’m serving, what makes them tick.”

The Pop-up will allow shops to present coffee that’s not confined to regional consumer demands but rather allow for both a laboratory for discovery and experimental experiences for the visitor. Over the period of 2 months, the guideline is to simply serve coffee as you choose to define it, espresso bar, cupping lab, drip bar, single brew, cold brew, coffee tasting and training, etc.

Within the 1 to 3 days, the shop will have the ability to retail their coffee bags and or merch as well as create an experience that defines the diversity of the local coffee community. We encourage shops to take the opportunity to explore new concepts or operate a bar in non-traditional ways so it challenges the customers experience and expectations.
